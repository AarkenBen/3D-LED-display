# LED boyz 

### Mission Statement
We are excited as a group to create a 3D LED display that provides an interactive experience for our users. The 3D LED display will be a cube composed of multiple LED’s separated by about half an inch where each individual LED will be addressable which will allow us to display different 3D models. The way in which our users will interact with this device is still unknown, but our goal is to challenge our capabilities as Computer Engineering students by working in a team aspect to push our knowledge even further in order to gain an understanding of 3D rendering using LEDs. Creating a 3D rendering will be a complicated task. It will require us to determine the dimensions and depth of a person/object in software which isn’t an easy task. Once overcoming these challenges and being successful in performing this task we will be able to narrow the focus on the best way for our product to be used.  For example, this technology will provide the opportunity to be used in the medical aspect as an alternative to X-rays and CAT scans by providing a higher resolution image of internal functions of the human body. The applications are endless once we have reached our goal of creating our interactive 3D LED display.
